Fun project I did in Summer '24. The goal is to input a .JPG image and have an AI model suggest a song that matches that image's mood and energy, given the songs that you aleady like. I use the Spotify API to guide the user through authentication, and then I access their most listened to artists. The user uploads a .JPG image from their file system and Gemini-pro-vision-1.5 will output a song and artist. If you have Spotify open (web player or mobile app), this program will start the song playback on your device!
To run yourself, you'll need to create your own Spotify developer credentials and Google Gemini API Key from the Developer Dashboard. 

Please feel free to fork this repo and make your own changes. Converting images to songs is a fun way for users to express their music taste and discover new songs.
